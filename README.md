## Introduction

This tool consist of three parts:
* The `miner` subproject is a packet decoder and feature extractor that produces output as JSON files and communicates over stdout or an IPC channel if available.
* `api` is a RESTful api based on Express.js which orchestrates the `miner` package if required.
* The `frontend` is a Vue.js based SPA that renders visualizations obtained from the api.

There are two ways to use this project:
* Just running the miner through the shell as described under `Development > miner`.
* Running the api (locally or on a server) and serving the frontend through a webserver

# Development

Clone the project from github:
```
git clone git@github.com:ddosgrid/ddosgrid-v2.git
```

## miner
Enter the `miner` subproject and install the necessary dependencies. Make sure you are running Node.JS version 10 and that you have libpcap installed.
```bash
cd miner
npm i
```
After that the miner package can be imported as an NPM module or it can be run manually through the shell. Alternatively one can use the miner as a subprocess where it will communicate over an IPC channel.
For example to run it through a shell:
```bash
node index.js pcap_path=/path/to/your/pcap-file
```
This will run the miner which will render its result to stdout:
```bash
node index.js pcap_path=/path/to/your/capture.pcap

✓ Input check completed
✓ Analysis started
✓ Setup of the following miners has completed:
	- Miscellaneous Metrics
	- Top 20 UPD/TCP ports by number of segments
	- Number of segments received over all TCP/UDP ports
	- Connection states of TCP segments
	- Analysis of IPv4 vs IPv6 traffic (based on packets)
	- Top 5 source hosts (IPv4)
	- Top 100 source hosts (IPv4)
✓ Decoding has finished, starting post-parsing analysis
✓ All miners have finished.

```

Run it as a subprocess:
```javascript
const child_process = require('child_process')
const fork = child_process.fork
const path = require('path')

// Options to run the miner as subprocess
var program = path.resolve('../miner/index.js')
var args = [ `pcap_path=${pcapPath}` ]
var options = { stdio: [ 'ipc' ] }

var childProcess = fork(program, args, options)

// Once the miner finishes he will send a 'message' with file paths
// pointing to the analysis results
childProcess.on('message', function (minerResults) {
  var parsedResults = JSON.parse(minerResults)
  // Do something with the JSON files
})
childProcess.on('exit', (code) => {
  if(code !== 0) {
    // Something went wrong
  }
})
```

## api
Setting up the api is straightforward simply fetch the dependencies and start the main javascript file. Make sure that you have previously installed the dependencies of the miner!
```bash
cd miner; npm i; cd ..;
cd api; npm i
```
Now simply run it and optionally pass the port where it should listen:
```bash
node index.js
```
or
```bash
export PORT=1234; node index.js
```
:warning: To use the OAuth2 authentication system, one would need to start the API using the development script in the `scripts` folder. This script will provide additional parameters.

:warning: If you want to invoke the DDoSDB export you will also need to clone the `converters` and `ddos_dissector` scripts into the root of the repository. Please follow the documentation of these repositories to set up the required dependencies.

## frontend
Enter the `frontend` subproject and run it after fetching its dependencies
```bash
npm i; npm run serve
```
This will automatically rebuild the project if a file changes. 
To use the application you will need to let it connect to an api instance.
In development mode (`npm run serve`) it will always connect to `localhost:3000`.

# Production deployment
There is no written documentation on how to deploy DDoSGrid/DDoSDB productively. A working documentation of such a configuration can be found in [ddosgrid/configuration-management](https://github.com/ddosgrid/configuration-management). That repository can be used as a 'working' documentation since all the steps required to setup all components will be shown. Alternatively, one may use the Ansible / Vagrant workflow to deploy the platform in an automated manner.
